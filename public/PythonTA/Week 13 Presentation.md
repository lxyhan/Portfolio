## 4. Technical Skills Learned

### Git Workflows
- **Independent branches**: Creating PRs from master, not building on each other
- **Atomic commits**: Breaking down large changes into reviewable chunks
- **Parallel development**: Enabling faster reviews and iteration

### CSS Architecture
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Maintainable theming system
- **Design tokens**: Consistent spacing, colors, and typography
- **Component thinking**: Scalable patterns for future development

### Modern Design Patterns
- **Progressive enhancement**: Accessibility-first approach
- **Visual hierarchy**: Strategic use of shadows and spacing
- **Design systems**: Following established patterns from industry leaders

### Snapshot Testing (Future)
- Understanding component state testing
- Visual regression prevention
- Automated UI consistency checks

## 5. Feedback from David

### Performance Expectations
**Reality Check**: 8-10 hours/week expectation vs actual delivery pace
**Action**: Increased velocity and more frequent PRs

### Technical Process
**Learning**: Each PR should branch from master, not build on others
**Result**: Recreated PRs as independent branches for easier review

### Responsibility & Ownership
**Insight**: Open-ended tasks require proactive breakdown into reviewable chunks
**Implementation**: Better task decomposition and frequent delivery

### Key Takeaway
*"Pull requests are the test of your contributions, not presentations"*

## Impact & Reflection

### What Actually Got Done
- **UI looks way better** - went from dated blue theme to something that feels modern
- **Dark mode works properly** - not just inverted colors, actual thought-out contrast
- **Code is cleaner** - CSS variables make sense now, easier to maintain
- **Everything feels more cohesive** - consistent spacing and colors throughout

### What I Learned About Myself
- I was batching work too much instead of shipping incrementally
- My git workflow was messy - dependent branches are a pain for reviewers
- I underestimated how long UI work takes when done properly
- Getting feedback stings but it's necessary for getting better

### Honest Process Changes
- Actually breaking down tasks instead of just saying I will
- Shipping smaller PRs more frequently (still working on this)
- Being more realistic about time estimates
- Asking for feedback earlier rather than presenting "finished" work

### What's Next
- Want to tackle more complex interaction patterns
- Interested in component architecture and reusability
- Need to get better at snapshot testing for UI consistency
