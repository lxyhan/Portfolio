## The Gathering

On Monday evenings, a curious transformation takes place at University College. What begins as a scatter of students clutching water bottles and adjusting shoelaces gradually swells into a gathering that defies the typical campus divisions. The historic cloisters become an impromptu meeting ground, the Gothic architecture a fitting backdrop for what has become one of campus's most dynamic communities.

This is the University of Toronto Run Club, a group I'm grateful to be organizing, though "club" feels too formal a word for what amounts to a voluntary congregation of people who've decided that running feels better in company. The weekly runs began simply enough: a few students meeting to share the burden of Toronto's hills and the beauty of its sunset-lit streets.

> Running often gets portrayed as a solitary pursuit, a battle against oneself. But watching the Monday evening groups split into their natural pace formations tells a different story.

The fastest runners circle back to encourage others, conversations flow between breaths, and somehow, the city feels a bit smaller with each shared kilometer.

## A Personal Evolution

My own relationship with running began in high school, born not from athletic ambition but from a need to quiet an anxious mind. Struggling with anxiety in my junior year of high school, I found that long night runs exhausted the mental clutter that made sleep elusive. There was a strange comfort in the rhythm of feet hitting pavement, in movement without destination.

What started as solitary therapy has evolved into something unexpectedly communal. The run club wasn't planned - it grew organically from shared needs: for movement, for connection, for a break from academic pressures. Now, watching new runners discover their capacity for distance or friendship, I'm reminded of running's simple gift: **it meets you exactly where you are**.

## The Community Current

Stories emerge between footfalls. A graduate student from abroad recently described how running became her anchor during the disorienting first months in Toronto¹. Another member discovered students committed to tangential research topics during a particularly challenging hill sprint². These connections, forged in shared effort, often outlast the runs themselves.

The club's informal structure seems to be its strength. Without pressure to perform or compete, members create their own definitions of success. Some aim for marathons, others for the simple victory of showing up consistently. Study groups have formed during cool-down walks, research collaborations have sparked over post-run coffee, and more than a few friendships have solidified during Toronto's less hospitable running weather.

## Seasonal Rhythms

Each season brings its character to our routes:

- **Fall** runs pass under Queen's Park's amber canopy
- **Winter** challenges us with snow-laden paths and the promise of warm campus cafes
- **Spring** teases with cherry blossoms along Philosopher's Walk
- **Summer** evenings often end with impromptu gatherings in Trinity Bellwoods Park

The rhythm of seasons mirrors the rhythm of academic life - each bringing its own challenges and rewards, each demanding a different kind of endurance.

## Beyond Running

There's something quietly revolutionary about creating space for others to succeed. The club has evolved beyond simply running - weekly sessions now incorporate HIIT workouts and yoga practices, recognizing that well-rounded fitness builds stronger runners and deeper connections. These varied activities, led by community members sharing their expertise, have transformed Monday gatherings into holistic wellness events.

The group's impact extends into the local community as well. Partnerships with neighborhood restaurants offer runners post-workout gathering spots, supporting local businesses while strengthening team bonds. The sight of runners in matching club merchandise - designed by student artists³ - has become a familiar presence in campus life, a visible symbol of belonging that extends beyond workout hours.

## Personal Reflections

Running has taught me that leadership often means simply creating space for others to thrive. When academic pressures mount and deadlines loom, our Monday runs offer a reminder that progress - in running as in life - rarely follows a linear path. Sometimes the best growth happens in the moments between achievements, in the quiet solidarity of shared movement.

The beauty of running lies in its simplicity. There's no need to micromanage every detail - trust the process, embrace the journey, and find joy in the act of moving forward. Whether the goal is running a marathon or simply clearing your head after a long day, every step counts, especially those taken together.

*In the end, the quiet revolution isn't about running at all - it's about rediscovering that some of life's most meaningful connections happen not in grand gestures, but in the simple act of moving forward together, one step at a time.*
