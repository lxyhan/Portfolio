Imagine this— It's 4 AM at NewHacks, and my team is scattered around a table littered with empty Red Bulls, practicing our pitch for the millionth time. We're exhausted but somehow still laughing – probably delirious from the lack of sleep. Welcome to my first university hackathon experience!

It was 24 hours of **pure chaos and creativity**: no registration, an impromptu team that clicked instantly, and a git reset that wiped my laptop keychain clean five minutes in¹. But here's the thing about hackathons – sometimes the best ideas come from embracing the unexpected. Between energy drinks and midnight debugging sessions, we learned more than any classroom could teach, created something meaningful, and somehow walked away with a win in our category.

> Not bad for a completely unplanned adventure.

## The Chaos Begins

Five minutes into NewHacks 2024, I had already managed to spectacularly sabotage myself. An ill-placed `git reset --hard` command wiped my laptop's entire keychain – every saved password, every authentication token, gone. If that's not a hackathon baptism by fire, I don't know what is.

But sometimes the universe has a sense of humor about these things. What could have been a disaster became the perfect icebreaker with my randomly assembled team, and honestly, starting from absolute zero felt oddly liberating.

## Learning to Pivot

The first few hours were humbling. Our team pitched idea after idea to the mentors, each one getting politely but firmly redirected. But you know what? Those early "no's" were exactly what we needed². Between energy drink runs and brainstorm sessions, we eventually found our direction with a project called **Close to Home**.

The vision was simple: help communities stay connected during natural disasters. Sure, our final product wasn't exactly what we'd imagined, but the journey of getting there taught us more than any perfect execution could have.

## When Reality Hits Different

Let me paint you a picture: it's midnight, our ML models are being spectacularly uncooperative, and we're faced with a choice - spiral into debug-doom or adapt. We chose the latter. Armed with SvelteKit, Flask, and an unhealthy amount of caffeine, we pivoted to focus on what really mattered - creating a platform that could help people connect when disaster strikes.

Those late-night hours brought out the best in our team, despite some classic hackathon chaos. Later, a desperate sprint back to my dorm for a charger (turns out laptops need those) turned into an unexpected moment of clarity. There's something about that brief escape from the intense focus that lets your mind reset. By the time I returned, breathless but recharged (literally and figuratively), we had a fresh perspective on our challenges.

> There's something uniquely bonding about problem-solving at 4 AM while practicing pitches that somehow get progressively worse and better at the same time.

These moments of shared struggle – whether it's recovering from a git disaster or hunting for a charger – often led to our most creative solutions.

## The Real MVPs

Here's what actually made our project work:

- **A team that clicked from the start**, turning potential frustrations into opportunities
- **The wisdom to know when to simplify** our scope (goodbye, overly ambitious ML features)
- **Quick breaks that sparked unexpected solutions**
- **A shared vision** that kept us focused when exhaustion hit
- **The ability to tell a compelling story** about why our project matters

## Lesson Learned: It's Not About Perfection

The biggest surprise? Winning our category wasn't about having the most polished code or the fanciest features. It was about having a clear vision and showing how technology could make a real impact, even if we couldn't implement every feature we dreamed up.

**The judges didn't care about our messy git history or the features we had to cut.** They cared about our story, our passion, and our ability to solve real problems with the tools we had.

## The Road Ahead

Now, with UofTHacks on the horizon, I'm carrying these lessons forward. But this time, instead of nervous uncertainty, I'm bringing excitement and a better game plan. I know when to push for that extra feature and when to step back and refocus. Most importantly, I know that the best projects come from teams that can laugh through the challenges while keeping their eyes on the goal.

## For the Hesitant Hackers

If you're sitting on the fence about joining a hackathon, here's my take: **you don't need to be a coding wizard or have the next billion-dollar idea**. You just need curiosity, resilience, and the willingness to learn. 

Yes, you'll be fueled by more Red Bulls than you thought humanly possible. Yes, your project will probably change direction at least three times. And yes, somehow CS students will still be too shy to talk to each other at 2 AM - some stereotypes apparently survive even sleep deprivation³. But those challenges? They're where the real growth happens.

The magic of a hackathon isn't in the perfect execution - it's in having a team that stays supportive even when the Red Bull runs low. While we overheard some teams flame each other in the early morning hours (stress and caffeine are a wild combo), our team kept the energy positive. 

> That's when I realized that the real hackathon victory isn't in the execution - it's in those moments when your team turns a seeming disaster into an opportunity, when a simple solution proves more powerful than a complex one, and when you realize you're capable of more than you thought possible.

If our paths cross at UofTHacks, come say hi. I'll be the one alternating between focused coding sprints and actual sprints to stay awake, this time with a bit more method to the madness.

*P.S. - Always backup your keychain before a hackathon. Trust me on this one.*
